    "Assets that exhibit significant mean-reversion are difficult to find in efficient markets. As a result, investors focus on creating long-short asset baskets to form a mean-reverting portfolio whose aggregate value shows mean-reversion. Classic solutions including cointegration or canonical correlation analysis can only construct dense mean-reverting portfolios, i.e. they include every asset in the investing universe. These portfolios have shown significant disadvantages in transaction costs, P&L interpretability, and capturing meaningful statistical arbitrage opportunities. On the other hand, sparse mean-reverting portfolios, which requires trading as few assets as possible, can mitigate these shortcomings.\n",

    "The notebook has demonstrated how to use ArbitrageLab to construct sparse mean-reverting portfolios using covariance selection techniques and structured VAR(1) estimate, greedy algorithm, and convex relaxation framework with SDP. The module allows considerable flexibility and efficiency for sparse mean-reverting portfolio construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the three approaches, greedy algorithm is the most robust due to its simplicity and the stableness of the portfolio it generates. As shown in the example, the portfolio generated by greedy algorithm was able to stand the test of a market crash. Moreover, greedy algorithm runs fast. Therefore, it is the top choice if given a completely new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convex relaxation framework has shown greater flexibility compared to the other two approaches as it allows addition of other constraints. The examples here has shown that a volatility lower bound could be added such that meaningful statistical arbitrage opportunities are available as the deviation from portfolio mean is greater. However, the mean-reversion strengths of the portfolios are slightly weaker than the one generated by the greedy algorithm, which is likely because the convex relaxation is not tight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance selection and structured VAR(1) estimate approach can narrow down the investing universe effectively. The examples have shown that the 45 international equity ETFs have been readily clustered into a 14-asset and an 8-asset subset from which a sparse mean-reverting portfolio can be constructed using Box-Tiao canonical decomposition. Note that this approach can be used in conjunction with the greedy algorithm and convex relaxation approach. For example, greedy algorithm can be directly applied to the aforementioned 14-asset subset."

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Greedy algorithm is the most robust approach among the three. It is recommended to try greedy algorithm first when given a new dataset.\n",
    "* Convex relaxation is the most flexible approach among the three. Extra constraints can be added, for example, a volatility lower threshold. However, the quality of the solution may be compromised due to an extra deflation step to yield the sparse weight vector.\n",
    "* Covariance selection and structured VAR(1) estimate is more of a preprocessing step among the three. This approach can efficiently narrow down the investing universe. Box-Tiao canonical decomposition, greedy algorithm, and convex relaxation can be all applied afterwards on the resulting asset subsets.\n",
    "* This module helps select which assets to trade and allocate the capital for each selected asset. It does **NOT** help decide the mean-reversion trading strategy. The users can choose whichever strategies they may find suitable for the highly mean-reverting portfolio."
