## Welcome to Arbitrage Research

This repository contains notebooks that demonstrate the use of strategies and tools in arbitragelab library to construct mean reverting portfolios.

ArbitrageLab started as a research project at Hudson and Thames, a quantitative research firm focussed on implementing production quality algorithms from top academic journals and reseach papers, and has been used by research teams at quantitative hedge funds for years. Remarkedly the firm has now taken an initiative to make it available to the global community so anyone with a passion for building quant strategies can benefit from it.
The library consists of implementations of statistical arbitrage strategies published in academic papers and follows [Krauss' taxonomy](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/116783/1/833997289.pdf) of Pairs Trading Strategies.

Each notebook in this repo provides illustrations of a specific strategy to create a mean reverting portfolio and can serve as a starting point for further exploration. The notebooks also provide links and references to papers where the strategy was first proposed. Feel free to check out the links if you feel the need to understand the mathematical or theoretical foundations behind the implementation.
